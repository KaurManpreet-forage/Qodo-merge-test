If only city and country are present, format as "City, Country" (e.g., "Paris, France")
If only city and state are present, format as "City, State" (e.g., "Austin, Texas")


COMBINE ALL LOCATIONS in a SINGLE STRING using pipe delimiter:

Format as: "City1, State1, Country1 | City2, State2 | City3, Country3"
